<h1 id="1)">1) Deploys network KPI visualization via Streamlit</h1>
<p>This is my deployment of network KPI visualization python app via <strong>Streamlit</strong> platform. Users are able to view different type of KPI 
on the selected nodes and compare them on day to day basis, using <strong>interactive</strong> chart. It is able to schedule the KPI to be refreshed hourly for early fault detection.
More data science projects such as capacity forecasting has been deployed on local servers.</p>

<p>This project is to predict the sales price of house using <strong>machine learning (Linear Regression)</strong>.By choosing appropriate features, a linear 
regression model is trained and then use to predict the sales prices of house in test dataset.</p>
<p>The approaches used are as below:</p>
