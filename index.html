<h1 id="1)">1) Deploys network KPI visualization via Streamlit</h1>
<p>This is my deployment of network KPI visualization python app via <strong>Streamlit</strong> platform. Users are able to view different type of KPI 
on the selected nodes and compare them on day to day basis, using <strong>interactive</strong> chart. It is able to schedule the KPI to be refreshed hourly for early fault detection.
More data science projects such as capacity forecasting has been deployed on local servers.</p>

<h1 id="2)">2) Machine Learning: Predict Sales Price of House (Linear Regression)</h1>
<p>This project is to predict the sales price of house using <strong>machine learning (Linear Regression)</strong>.By choosing appropriate features, a linear 
regression model is trained and then use to predict the sales prices of house in test dataset.</p>
<p>The approaches used are as below:</p>

<p>This project is to predict the survivability of titanic passengers using <strong>machine learning (KNN)</strong>.By choosing appropriate features, a KNN 
regression model is trained and then use to predict the survivability of titanic passengers (0=Dead, 1=Survived) in test dataset.</p>

<h1 id="5)">5) Network Alarm Analysis </h1>
<p>This project is automate the anlaysis of <strong>historical network alarm</strong> using python. It will analyse the alarms based on severity type and frequency of 
occurance. In the end, it will shows the top 20 highest occurance alarm code. This is crucial to know about the performance of network on weekly basis.</p>
